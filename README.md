# This is the BeepBoopPack

What does it do you ask? It *Beeps* and it *Boops*, that's pretty much it.

## How to install the pack

Using the X Minecraft launcher, create a new instance of Minecraft 1.19.2 with Fabric 0.14.24.

Download the `install-mods.ps1` script and place that into the folder of the instance that you just created (the default location in windows is the .xmcl folder in your current user directory).
Additionally download the `packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar` from the packwiz release page at [https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases) and put it next to the install-mods script file in the instanct folder.

Run the `install-mods.ps1` script and hopefully watch all the mods get downloaded.
